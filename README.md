#### Code disclaimer,
You Are welcome to download this project and use any code that could help with what you are trying to accomplish, all I ask is that you reference me for the code that you use.

#### Description
This code was built just with HTML5, CSS, and jQuery. Some Raw Javascript.
I had been inspired by Coolors.com to try and create a color picker and pallet creator. This project is a massively dumbed down version of Fabrizio's site but I think this was a great experience using Jquery. Over the past year, I have been working with React.js nonstop and like to dabble in with Jquery once in a while.
